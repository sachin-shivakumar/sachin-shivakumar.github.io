## Computer systems are the smartest and the dumbest invention ever made by humans

At first glance, the above statement is self-contradictory (or vague, at the very least) and hence requires more explanation. The **idea** of a computer system (an object that does computations) is **smart**, but the *computer system* itself is *dumb* by human standards; Computers only do what you ask from it --- nothing more nothing less. Computers cannot think on their own and cannot perform any computation without explicit instructions. 

> They do not have any independent thoughts or opinions.

While there are various instruments that are attributed to be the *first computer*, we will restrict our discussion to the *Analytical engine* invented by Charles Babbage in the 19th century. The idea behind this system was simple but useful. Use a punch card to tell the sequence of arithmetic operations (addition/multiplication) to perform and the engine does it. 

> To this day, all computing devices follow the same principle. 

While computing devices have grown more energy-efficient, time-efficient, and compact, they still require a punch card. For example, there does not exist a computer that, when plugged to a wall, would develop a way to communicate with others by writing its own operating system (or even learn to write a simple ***Hello World***). Therefore, we still need to build a punch card (a program) --- just like we did two centuries ago.

Rather than making a list of things a computer cannot do, I want to state the things I wish a computer could do. Then we can figure out a way to build such a computer --- *maybe*.
