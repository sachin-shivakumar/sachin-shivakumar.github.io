## Computer systems are the smartest and the dumbest invention ever made by humans

At first glance, the above statement sounds self-contradictory (or vague, at the very least) and, hence, requires more explanation. The **idea** of a computer system (an object that does computations) is **smart**, but the *computer system* itself is *dumb* by human standards; Computers only do what you ask from it --- nothing more, nothing less. Computers cannot perform any computation without explicit instructions. 

> They do not have any independent thoughts or opinions.

While there are various instruments that are attributed to be the *first computer*, we will restrict our discussion to the *Analytical engine* invented by Charles Babbage in the 19th century. The idea behind this system was simple but useful. Use a punch card to tell the sequence of arithmetic operations (addition/multiplication) to perform and the engine does it. However, without this `punch card`, analytical engine cannot perform any action (except converting electricity into heat --- not very helpful). 

> To this day, all computing devices follow the same principle. 

While computing devices have grown more energy-efficient, time-efficient, and compact, they still require a punch card. For example, there does not exist a computer that, when plugged to a wall, would develop a way to communicate with others by writing its own operating system (or even learn to write a simple ***Hello World***). Therefore, we still need to build a punch card (a program) --- just like Babbage did two centuries ago. 

> A computer that learns and uses the information given to it to make some change.

Rather than making a list of things a computer cannot do, I want to state the things I wish a computer could do. Then we can figure out a way to build such a computer --- *maybe*. In simple words, I want a computing machine that can **observe its surroundings** (data fed through sensors) and **learn something from its observations** (build a mathematical model) and **demonstrate its knowledge** (manipulate the surroundings to get a desired result).

> Lets talk math

Now that we have *vague* goals, let us try to translate those goals into solvable mathematical problems. 

* First, *observation of surroundings* is a simple enough task which can be done by various means, such as, electrical sensors, visual sensors, thermal sensors, etc.,--- all sensors that convert information into electrical signals. However, the term information is broad, unclear, and contains unnecessary details (which can be noise). Therefore, we classify the information further into two specific categories that will the computer in parsing the information in a meaningful manner. Namely, we split the information into a set of actions taken (input, $$u$$) and result of those actions (output, $$y$$).
