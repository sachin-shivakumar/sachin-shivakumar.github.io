> Computer systems are the smartest and the dumbest invention ever made by humans

At first glance (or maybe a few more than one glance), the above statement is self-contradictory (or vague at the very least) and hence requires more explanation. The idea of a computer system (an object that does all the calculations for you) is smart, but the computer system itself is dumb by human standards; Computers only do what you ask from it - nothing more nothing less. They do not have any independent thoughts or opinions.

While there were various instruments claimed to be the ''first computer'' (some claims are more ridiculuous than others), we will restrict our discussion to the `Analytical engine` invented by Charles Babbage in the 19th century. The idea behind this system was simple but useful. Use a program to tell the sequence of arithmetic operations (addition/multiplication) to performed and the system does it. To this day, all computing devices follow the same principle.
