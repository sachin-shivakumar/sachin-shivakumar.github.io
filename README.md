Welcome to the github repository for the website [sachin-shivakumar.github.io](https://sachin-shivakumar.github.io). 

The website will list my past and current academic projects as well as other non-academic projects that I undertake. 

In the near future, I intend to add:

1. Personal study/observations on different fields, such as, control theory, machine learning, functional analysis, geometric theory, etc.
2. Personal study/observations of important papers/results in the above mentioned fields
3. Link my other github repositories and setup modules to test run some codes online

# Contributions

Contribution/collaboration to existing (or new) projects listed on the website are welcome. However, any contributions to the website itself will not be accepted.

Contact me via email at sachin.shivakumar@asu.edu.
