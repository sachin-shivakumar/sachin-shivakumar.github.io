SOSTOOLS is a free MATLAB toolbox for formulating and solving sums of squares (SOS) optimization programs. SOSTOOLS can be used to specify and solve sum of squares polynomial problems using a very simple, flexible, and intuitive high-level notation. The SOS programs can be solved using SeDuMi, SDPT3, CSDP, SDPNAL, SDPNAL+, CDCS and SDPA. All these are well-known semidefinite programming solvers, with SOSTOOLS handling internally all the necessary reformulations and data conversion.
