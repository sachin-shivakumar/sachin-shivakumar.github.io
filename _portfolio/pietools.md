title: "PIETOOLS"
excerpt: "PIETOOLS is a free MATLAB toolbox for manipulating Partial Integral (PI) operators and solving Linear PI Inequalities (LPIs) which are convex optimization problems involving PI variables and PI constraints. <br/><img src='/images/pietools_logo.png' width='200' height='270'>"

PIETOOLS can be used to:
* define 3-PI or 4-PI operators
* declare 3-PI or 4-PI operators variables (postive semidefinite or indefinite)
* add operator inequality constraints
* solve LPI optimization problems

The interface is inspired by YALMIP while the optimization problem structure is based on SOSTOOLS. By default, the LPIs are solved using SeDuMi, however, the toolbox also supports use of other SDP solvers such as Mosek, sdpt3 and sdpnal.
